# MinimalIoC
A minimal IoC implementation using AutoFac for your .Net core projects.
This solution automates the regiestration of dependencies of type <Interface,Implementation>.  
You can extend its behavior to support custom configurations(defines scopes, custom dependencies registration,...).  
You will two UI implementation, one for .Net core 6 using the single template and a second for previous versions of .Net core with a program.cs and startup.cs.  
# Unit Tests
I did not set unit tests here, it is bad I know! Maybe for the next release.
